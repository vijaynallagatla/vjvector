## üìù Common Workflows

### Daily Development
```bash
make setup-dev          # First time setup
make cluster-dev        # Start development cluster
make dev                # Run with hot reloading
# ... make changes ... (automatic rebuild)
make test               # Run tests
make format             # Format code
make lint               # Check code quality
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
make setup-prod         # Setup production environment
make cluster-prod        # Start production cluster
make cluster-info        # Verify cluster status
make cluster-health      # Check health
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
make cluster-status      # Check what's running
make cluster-logs        # View logs
make cluster-health      # Check health status
make cluster-test        # Test connectivity
make cluster-resources   # Check resource usage
```

### Scaling Operations
```bash
make cluster-scale SCALE=5  # Scale to 5 nodes
make cluster-status          # Verify scaling
make cluster-health          # Check all nodes health
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Prerequisites**: Docker and Docker Compose must be installed
- **Ports**: Ensure required ports (80, 8080-8085, 9090, 3000, 6379) are available
- **Resources**: Production cluster requires at least 8GB RAM and 20GB disk space
- **Cleanup**: Use `make cluster-cleanup` carefully as it removes all data
- **Scaling**: Scaling operations may require load balancer configuration updates
